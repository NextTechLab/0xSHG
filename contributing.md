### UI Design
User interface design is currently underway on SonarUI and MineUI - the user interfaces for data scientists and data hosts respectively. These are currently being discussed in the UI channel of Slack.

### UX Testing
We need lots of testers. Currently, this work is not related to any user interfaces, as those have not yet been designed or developed. We will have more need for this in the **very** near future, however. Feel free to reach out in the UX channel of Slack.

### Legal and Marketing
For any of these topics - reach out to @trask in Slack. The needs of each are varied... here are a few examples:

There are a plethora of legal issues that come with a person taking back ownership of their information. How is ownership of data is transferred or dissolved after death? How tightly can we implement with third-party data providers from a legal perspective? What does the future of data ownership look like from a legal perspective?

We have a highly capable set of creative people working on the brand of OpenMined. How do we get this brand to be viewed positively by developers? How would a rollout to the general public work? How much time should an open source project spend on marketing itself?

### Anything else?
We'd love to have you! The only requirement for joining the OpenMined contributor network is a desire to follow the core values and vision of the project. Feel free to reach out in the #general-discussion, #beginner, and #questions channel on Slack and someone will be sure to point you in the right direction!

## Step 5: Congratulations You're Ready!

You now have the basics of the OpenMined ecosystem up and running and are ready to take on `beginner` level projects (Issues). We've gone out of our way to make sure that there are a plethora of mini-projects (Issues) that are 100% entry level. The way to find one is to pick any GitHub repository and click the *Issues* Tab at the top. This should take you to a place that looks like this.

![Issues.png](https://github.com/OpenMined/Docs/raw/master/img/issues.png)


Next, you click "Labels -> good first issue".


Or, click on this link:
[Labels -> good first issue](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).


This will filter out all tickets except for the `good first issue` tickets.


Click one of the tickets and you'll see something like this:

![https://github.com/OpenMined/Docs/raw/master/img/beginner_ticket.png](https://github.com/OpenMined/Docs/raw/master/img/beginner_ticket.png)

This ticket contains instructions for how to add a subtraction function to our Base Tensor object, with links to further documentation to help explain everything the ticket should do. If you have ANY questions about a ticket, simply message the person who created the ticket (in the ticket above, that's @trask on Slack)

Before beginning work, make sure to be aware of our [contributing guidelines](./guidelines.md).

Once your first Pull Request is merged into an OpenMined repository, you'll get your official invite to become a *Member of the Github Organization*!
